Recommendation System
 
 Instructions
 
 - Build a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization techniques.
 
 - Deliverable: A notebook or app showcasing recommendation results and evaluation metrics.
 
 Notebook Description
 
 The notebook `Task4.ipynb` includes the implementation of a recommendation system. It applies
 collaborative filtering or matrix factorization methods for generating personalized recommendations.
 The key steps include:
 
 1. Data loading and preprocessing
 
 2. Implementation of a recommendation algorithm (e.g., matrix factorization)
 
 3. Model training and prediction
 
 4. Evaluation using metrics such as RMSE or precision/recall
 
 Usage Instructions
 
 1. Clone the GitHub repository.
 
 2. Open `Task4.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
 
 3. Run the notebook to generate and evaluate recommendations.
 
 4. Modify parameters or datasets to test different recommendation techniques
